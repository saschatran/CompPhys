# Computational Physics Project

## About the Project

The task of this course was to solve two large projects out of 6 given. The goal of each project is to develop a short program which solves a simple physical problem.
The projects including their instructions can be found in the following script: https://comphys.unibas.ch/TEACH/CP/course.pdf

The following two projects were chosen:
- Sorting continuously growing data sets (script page 18)
- Determination of the melting temperature of silicon by a molecular dynamics simulation (script page 131)

PLease consult the script and the [Computational Physics Praktikum.pdf](https://github.com/saschatran/CompPhys/blob/main/Computational%20Physics%20Praktikum.pdf) for a more detailed description of the projects and their results.

The project tasks were coded in Fortran. As for the analysis, Python was used.
